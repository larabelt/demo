<p>This Privacy Policy establishes the privacy practices of Cool Demo Place's website (the "Site"). Specifically, it outlines the types of
    information that we gather about you while you are using the Site, and the ways in which we use and share this information. This Privacy Policy
    does not apply to any information collected offlineâ€”whether provided by you or collected by us through other means (for example, via telephone or
    through the mail). By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is
    governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We may collect and store information, including personally-identifiable information (such as your name, phone number or email address) or other
    information, that you voluntarily supply to us while on our Site. Some examples of this type of information include information that you
    electronically submit when you contact us with questions and information that you electronically submit when you complete an online form. We do
    not collect or store personally-identifiable information for purposes other than responding to your inquiry, or for otherwise providing the
    service you requested at the time such information was provided.</p>

<p>We also collect and store non-personally identifiable information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Site. For example, we
    may collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web
    pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your
    experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and
    when visitors use the Site, cookies help us identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. This Site also may use
    web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open
    HTML-formatted email messages.</p>

<p>The information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a third-party website hosting provider, or another
    third-party service provider, on our behalf.</p>

<p>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including, for example, to process your request,
    provide you with services and communications that you have requested, send you email updates and other communications and customize features that
    appear on the Site, deliver our Site content to you, measure Site traffic, measure user interests and traffic patterns, and improve the Site and
    the services and features offered via the Site. In addition, we may use any information submitted by or collected from you via the Site for any
    purpose related to the Site, including to contact you for customer service purposes, to inform you of important changes or additions to our Site
    or the services offered over our Site, and to send you administrative notices and any other communications that we believe may be of interest to
    you.</p>

<p>We also may provide your information to our affiliates or to third parties, including our third-party service providers and contractors, for
    purposes related to Site administration and operation only.</p>

<p>We also make some content, products and services available through our Site through cooperative relationships with third-party providers. We may
    share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in
    cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, which should be clear to you, the provider partner may collect information from you
    directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your information. The privacy
    policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you
    should contact the provider partner directly for more information. Please be aware that we reserve the right to share information about our
    visitors if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process;
    (b) to enforce our Terms of Service; or (c) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our Site, us, our affiliates, our officers,
    directors, employees, representatives, our licensors, other users, and/or the public.</p>

<p>Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or
    our Site is acquired by another company, information about our Site users may be among the transferred assets.</p>

<h2>DATA COLLECTION</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as from what sites visitors are
    coming from when they visit our Site, when they first visited our Site, their Internet Protocol (IP) address, how many visitors visit a specific
    page on the Site, how long they stay on a page and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We may use the IP address to infer information about
    such visitor, including its company, city and state. We collect this information through the use of "cookies" and other tracking technologies. We
    collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Site are most popular and to enhance the Site for visitors. We may group this
    information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, or
    other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, please be assured this aggregate data will in no way personally identify
    you, or any other visitors, to the Site.</p>

<p>California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to
    know how Cool Demo Place responds to "Do Not Track" browser settings. We do not currently take any actions with respect to do no track signals
    from a web site browser. You may, however, refuse or delete cookies. Please refer to your browser Help, Settings, or other similar instructions to
    learn more about cookies and other technologies and how to manage their use. If you elect to refuse or delete cookies, you will need to repeat
    this process if you use another computer, or change browsers. If you choose to decline cookies, some of the functionality of the Site and other
    websites may be impaired.</p>

<h2>STORAGE OF INFORMATION AND SECURITY</h2>
<p>All information gathered on our Site is stored within a database to which only we, and our hosting services provider, are provided access. However,
    as effective as the reasonable security measures implemented by us may be, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot
    guarantee the security of our Site's servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being
    transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>

<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
    These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security
    measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to employees,
    contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by
    confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these
    obligations.</p>

<h2>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
<p>This Site is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we
    become aware that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable
    efforts to delete such information from our database.</p>

<h2>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a
    notice on the homepage of the Site for a reasonable period of time after such changes are made that this Privacy Policy has been updated and by
    changing the "Last Modified" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your
    continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>

<h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>
<p>Cool Demo Place makes no representation that this Privacy Policy and such practices comply with the laws of any other country. Visitors who use
    the Site and reside outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the
    extent local laws are applicable. If you reside outside of the United States, by using our Site, you consent to the transfer and use of your
    information outside your country. Any disputes with respect to these terms shall be governed by the laws of the state of West Virginia.</p>
