<p>In the media, marketing, and advertising industry, Cool Demo Place is a significant departure from legacy consolidation models. Built to respond
    to the dramatic shifts in the strategic and ad-tech landscape, our goal is to find highly successful and relevant specialty shops and give them
    access to the capabilities they need to thrive going forward.</p>

<p>Our approach benefits clients who understand the value of working side-by-side with seasoned agency principals and teams that are quick, accurate,
    and results-driven.</p>

<p>As a House of Brands, we seek to maintain the independence, daily operations, decision making, and service offering of each shop in our network.
    However, all can leverage the full capabilities across the network: media, social, search, programmatic, digital strategy and experience,
    merchandising, design, research and insights, analytics, experiential brand activation and brand strategy â€“ all seamlessly and competitively
    priced.</p>
